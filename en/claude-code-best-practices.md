# Claude Code Best Practices Guide: Secret Weapons for Efficient Development

## üéØ Introduction

Mastering the correct usage of Claude Code is key to improving development efficiency. This guide shares proven best practices to help you maximize Claude Code's potential.

## üìã Project Configuration Optimization

### 1. Create CLAUDE.md Documentation
Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project root - this is key for Claude Code to understand your project:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview
- Tech Stack: React + TypeScript + Node.js
- Architecture Pattern: Microservices Architecture
- Database: PostgreSQL + Redis

## Core Commands
- `npm run dev` - Development environment
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run lint` - Code linting

## Project Structure
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/services/` - API service layer
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions
- `tests/` - Test files
```

### 2. Configure Development Preferences
Clearly specify your preferences in global configuration:

```markdown
## Development Preferences
- Package Manager: pnpm (mandatory)
- Code Style: ESLint + Prettier
- Testing Framework: Jest + React Testing Library
- CSS Solution: Tailwind CSS
```

## üí° Efficient Interaction Techniques

### 1. Precise Requirement Description
**Good Example**:
> "Add avatar upload functionality to UserProfile component, supporting drag-and-drop and click upload, file size limit 5MB for JPG/PNG formats, show preview after upload"

**Avoid Vague Descriptions**:
> "Add upload feature to user page"

### 2. Provide Sufficient Context
- Share relevant code file paths
- Explain current tech stack and constraints
- Describe expected behavior and results
- Mention relevant business logic

### 3. Handle Complex Tasks Step by Step
For complex features, break them down into multiple steps:
```
1. First design data models and API interfaces
2. Implement backend API logic
3. Create frontend components and state management
4. Write test cases
5. Optimize performance and user experience
```

## üîß Code Quality Management

### 1. Leverage Automated Code Review
- Have Claude Code review code changes before each commit
- Focus on code standards, performance optimization, and security issues
- Ensure test coverage meets project standards

### 2. Continuous Refactoring Strategy
```bash
# Regular code health checks
claude-code analyze --scope=project --focus=technical-debt
claude-code refactor --target=performance --safe-mode
```

### 3. Test-Driven Development
- First have Claude Code help write test cases
- Implement feature code based on test cases
- Ensure tests cover key business logic

## üöÄ Efficiency Enhancement Tips

### 1. Fully Utilize Sub-Agent System
Choose appropriate specialized agents based on task type:

- **Frontend Tasks**: Use frontend-developer agent
  ```bash
  /agent frontend-developer "Optimize React component performance, reduce unnecessary re-renders"
  ```

- **Backend Architecture**: Use backend-architect agent
  ```bash
  /agent backend-architect "Design user authentication system API architecture"
  ```

- **DevOps Tasks**: Use devops-automator agent
  ```bash
  /agent devops-automator "Set up GitHub Actions automated deployment workflow"
  ```

### 2. MCP Service Integration
Configure and use MCP (Model Context Protocol) services:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "memory": {
        "command": "npx @knowall-ai/mcp-neo4j-agent-memory",
        "transport": "stdio"
      },
      "browser-tools": {
        "command": "npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp",
        "transport": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Intelligent Code Generation Workflow

#### a) Component Development Workflow
```
1. Describe component requirements and design specifications
2. Generate basic component structure
3. Add styling and interaction logic
4. Write test cases
5. Optimize performance and accessibility
```

#### b) API Development Workflow
```
1. Design API interface specifications
2. Generate route and controller code
3. Implement data validation and business logic
4. Write API tests
5. Add error handling and logging
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Compliance

### 1. Code Security Checks
- Regular security scans
- Check dependency vulnerabilities
- Verify input validation and SQL injection protection
- Ensure sensitive information is not committed to codebase

### 2. Compliance Management
```markdown
## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] GDPR data privacy compliance
- [ ] Open source license compatibility
- [ ] Enterprise security policy adherence
- [ ] Code review process completeness
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring and Optimization

### 1. Code Performance Analysis
- Use Claude Code to analyze performance bottlenecks
- Identify memory leaks and unnecessary computations
- Optimize database queries and API calls
- Implement caching strategies

### 2. Build Optimization
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
claude-code analyze --type=bundle-size --suggestions

# Optimize webpack configuration
claude-code optimize --target=build-performance
```

## üîÑ Team Collaboration Best Practices

### 1. Unified Development Standards
- Establish team-level Claude Code configuration
- Share project templates and code standards
- Unify third-party library and tool choices

### 2. Knowledge Sharing
- Document Claude Code usage tips and experiences
- Share effective prompts and workflows
- Build project-specific best practice documentation

### 3. Code Review Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/claude-review.yml
name: Claude Code Review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Claude Code Review
        uses: anthropic/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          focus: security,performance,maintainability
```

## üéØ Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### 1. Over-reliance on AI
- Maintain understanding and control of code
- Verify AI-generated code logic
- Regular manual code reviews

### 2. Ignoring Tests
- Always write tests for AI-generated code
- Verify edge cases and exception handling
- Ensure test coverage of core business logic

### 3. Improper Configuration
- Regularly update Claude Code configuration
- Adjust settings according to project changes
- Monitor AI suggestion quality and relevance

## üåü Advanced Techniques

### 1. Custom Tool Creation
```python
# Create project-specific tools
class DatabaseMigrationTool:
    def analyze_schema_changes(self):
        # Analyze database schema changes
        pass
    
    def generate_migration_script(self):
        # Generate migration script
        pass
```

### 2. Workflow Automation
```bash
# Create custom command aliases
alias code-review="claude-code review --strict-mode --focus=all"
alias quick-fix="claude-code fix --auto-commit --run-tests"
alias optimize="claude-code optimize --performance --maintainability"
```

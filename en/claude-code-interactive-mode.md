## Command History

Claude Code provides powerful command history functionality to help you quickly reuse previous commands:

### History Management
- **Storage method**: History stored by working directory
- **Clear method**: Use `/clear` command to clear
- **Navigation method**: Use up/down arrow keys to navigate history
- **Search feature**: **Ctrl+R** reverse search history (if terminal supports)

### Notes
- **History expansion**: `!` commands are disabled by default to avoid accidental execution of history commands

## Practical Tips

### Efficient Input Tips

1. **Code Block Input**
   - Directly paste code blocks, Claude Code will automatically detect and preserve formatting
   - Use `\` + `Enter` to quickly add new lines

2. **Command Combinations**
   - Combine slash commands with regular conversation
   - Use `#` prefixed messages to add to project memory

3. **History Reuse**
   - Use arrow keys to quickly find previous commands
   - `Esc` + `Esc` to edit last message instead of retyping

### Workflow Optimization

1. **Multi-line Editing**
   ```
   # Use backslash continuation
   This is the first line \
   This is the second line \
   This is the third line
   ```

2. **Quick Memory Addition**
   ```
   # This information will be added to CLAUDE.md
   Remember: This project uses TypeScript + React
   ```

3. **Command Chaining**
   ```
   /model opus
   Please help me optimize this code's performance
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Multi-line input not working?**
- Check if terminal supports corresponding shortcuts
- Try using `/terminal-setup` to configure Shift+Enter
- Use universal `\` + `Enter` method

**Vim mode won't enable?**
- Confirm using `/vim` command
- Check configuration settings via `/config`
- Restart Claude Code session

**History search not working?**
- Confirm terminal supports Ctrl+R
- Check terminal's key binding settings
- Try using up/down arrow keys for manual navigation

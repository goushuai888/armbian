## Custom Slash Commands

Custom slash commands allow you to define frequently used prompts as Markdown files to automate workflows.

### Command Types

#### Project Commands
Stored in the project repository and shared with the team. Displayed as "(project)" in `/help`.

**Location**: `.claude/commands/`

**Example: Creating `/optimize` command**
```bash
# Create command file
mkdir -p .claude/commands
echo "Please optimize the following code for performance and readability:\n\n\$ARGUMENTS" > .claude/commands/optimize.md
```

#### Personal Commands
Personal commands available in all projects. Displayed as "(user)" in `/help`.

**Location**: `~/.claude/commands/`

**Example: Creating `/security-review` command**
```bash
# Create personal command
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cat > ~/.claude/commands/security-review.md << EOF
---
description: Perform security code review
allowed-tools: Bash(grep:*), Bash(find:*)
---
Please perform a comprehensive security review of the following code:

\$ARGUMENTS

Focus on:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS attack vectors
- Authentication and authorization issues
- Sensitive data leak risks
EOF
```

### Command Features

#### Namespaces
Organize commands through subdirectories, supporting hierarchical management:

```bash
.claude/commands/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component.md     # Creates /component command, displays "(project:frontend)"
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ style.md         # Creates /style command
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.md          # Creates /api command, displays "(project:backend)"
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ database.md     # Creates /database command
```

#### Argument Handling

**Method 1: Use `$ARGUMENTS` to get all arguments**
```markdown
# File: .claude/commands/translate.md
Please translate the following content to English:

$ARGUMENTS
```

Usage example:
```bash
/translate This code needs optimization
```

**Method 2: Use positional arguments `$1`, `$2`, etc.**
```markdown
# File: .claude/commands/commit.md
---
argument-hint: <type> <message>
description: Create standardized Git commit message
---
git commit -m "$1: $2"

If no arguments provided:
- Type: ${1:-feat}
- Message: ${2:-update code}
```

Usage example:
```bash
/commit fix Fix user login issue
/commit feat Add new search functionality
```

#### Bash Command Execution
Execute bash commands in commands and include output:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git status:*), Bash(git diff:*)
---
# Git Status Report

Current repository status:
!git status --short

Recent changes:
!git log --oneline -5
```

#### File References
Use `@` prefix to reference file contents:

```markdown
# Analyze code quality of the following files:

@src/utils/helpers.js
@src/components/UserForm.vue

Please focus on:
- Code structure and organization
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Potential bugs
```

#### Extended Thinking Mode
Trigger Claude's deep thinking through keywords:

```markdown
---
description: Architecture design review
---
Please think deeply about the following architecture design:

$ARGUMENTS

<thinking>
Need to analyze from multiple angles:
1. Scalability
2. Maintainability
3. Performance impact
4. Security considerations
</thinking>
```

### Front Matter Configuration

Command files support YAML front matter configuration:

| Field | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `allowed-tools` | List of tools the command can use | Inherit conversation settings |
| `argument-hint` | Argument hint information | None |
| `description` | Brief command description | Use first line of prompt |
| `model` | Specify model | Inherit conversation settings |

**Complete Example**:
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(npm run test:*), Bash(npm run lint:*)
argument-hint: [component-name] [--with-tests]
description: Create new Vue component
model: claude-3-sonnet-20240229
---
# Create Vue Component: $1

Please create a Vue component named $1.

${2:---with-tests}

If --with-tests argument is included, also create corresponding test file.

!npm run generate:component $1
```

## MCP Slash Commands

MCP servers can expose prompts as slash commands, enabling deep integration with external services.

### Command Format
MCP commands follow the naming pattern: `/mcp__<server-name>__<prompt-name>`

### Features

#### Dynamic Discovery
MCP commands are automatically available when:
- MCP server is connected and active
- Server exposes prompts via MCP protocol
- Prompts are successfully retrieved during connection

#### Argument Support
```bash
# GitHub MCP example commands
/mcp__github__create_issue "Bug: Login page inaccessible" "Users report unable to access login page"
/mcp__github__list_repos "user:myusername"
```

#### Naming Conventions
- Server and prompt names are normalized
- Spaces and special characters become underscores
- Names converted to lowercase for consistency

### Managing MCP Connections
Use `/mcp` command for management:

```bash
/mcp                     # View all configured MCP servers
/mcp list               # View connection status
/mcp auth github        # OAuth authentication
/mcp clear-auth github  # Clear authentication token
```

### MCP Permission Configuration
When configuring MCP tool permissions, note that **wildcards are not supported**:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "mcp__github",                    // ‚úÖ Correct: Approve all tools from github server
      "mcp__github__get_issue",         // ‚úÖ Correct: Approve specific tool
      "mcp__context7__search_docs"      // ‚úÖ Correct: Approve documentation search tool
    ],
    "deny": [
      "mcp__github__*"                  // ‚ùå Wrong: Wildcards not supported
    ]
  }
}
```

## Practical Examples
